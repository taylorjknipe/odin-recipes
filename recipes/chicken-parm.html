    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>½ cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>½ cup grated provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450° F.</li>
        <li>Pound/flatten chicken to a thickness of 1/2-inch with the smooth
            <br>side of a meat mallet.</li>
        <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper.Using a sifter or
            <br>strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating
            <br>both sides.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese ina separate bowl,
            <br>set aside.</li>
        <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast
            <br>to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides.
            <br>Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat
            <br>until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until
            <br>golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish
            <br>cooking in the oven.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons
            <br>tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of
            <br>mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle
            <br>remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon
            <br>olive oil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and
            <br>chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20
            <br>minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
            <br>should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
