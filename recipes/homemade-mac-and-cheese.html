        <li>2 ½ cups milk, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        <li>1 pinch ground paprika</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350° F. Grease an 8-inch square baking dish</li>
        <li>Make the macaroni and cheese:
            <br>Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer,
            <br>stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes;
            <br>it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat.
            <br>Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown,
            <br>3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer.
            <br>Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season
            <br>with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted
            <br>and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup
            <br>more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Make the bread crumb topping:
            <br>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook
            <br>and stir until well coated and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and
            <br>cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling,
            <br>about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
